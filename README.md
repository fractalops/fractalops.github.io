- Add new posts to the `_posts/` directory using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
- Copy the template from `CONTENT_GUIDE.md`
- Images go in `assets/images/` and reference as `/assets/images/your-image.jpg`

**üìñ Read `CONTENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed writing instructions**

## üåê Custom Domain

> TODO: If you have a custom domain, add it to the `CNAME` file and configure your DNS.

1. Create a `CNAME` file with your domain name (e.g., `myname.com`).
2. Update your DNS to point to GitHub Pages. See [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages).
3. Enable HTTPS in your repo settings.
