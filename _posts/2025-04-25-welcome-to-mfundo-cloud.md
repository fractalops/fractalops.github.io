# Welcome

I'm Mfundo, an infrastructure engineer and DevOps specialist from South Africa. This blog documents practical insights from building and operating cloud infrastructure at scale.

## What You'll Find Here

I write about cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, and software delivery. You can expect:

### **Infrastructure Engineering**
Cloud architecture patterns, infrastructure as code, and building resilient systems. Real-world experiences with AWS, Azure, and other cloud platforms.

### **Distributed Systems**
System design, performance optimization, monitoring, and keeping complex systems running in production.

### **Software Delivery**
Code, patterns, and lessons from building reliable delivery pipelines and the systems that power modern infrastructure.

### **Platform Engineering**
Building internal developer platforms, tooling, and self-service capabilities that enable teams to ship faster while maintaining security and cost efficiency.

## My Background

I specialize in building reliable, scalable cloud infrastructure. My work includes:

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Designing and implementing scalable architectures on AWS, Azure, and other platforms
- **DevOps Practices**: Building CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, and fostering collaboration between development and operations teams
- **Platform Engineering**: Creating internal developer platforms and tooling that enable self-service capabilities
- **System Reliability**: Ensuring high availability and performance of production systems
- **Cost Optimization**: Balancing performance requirements with infrastructure costs

I've worked with organizations from startups to enterprise, helping them build and scale their cloud infrastructure.
