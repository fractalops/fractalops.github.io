# Welcome 

Hello and welcome to my new technical blog! I'm Mfundo, an infrastructure engineer and DevOps specialist from South Africa, and I'm excited to share this space with you.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is where I'll be documenting my journey through the ever-evolving landscape of cloud infrastructure, system engineering, and software development. You can expect:

### **Infrastructure Engineering**
Deep dives into cloud architecture patterns, infrastructure as code, and building resilient, secure, scalable systems. I'll share real-world experiences with AWS, Azure, and other cloud platforms.

### **System Engineering**
Practical insights into system design, performance optimization, monitoring, and the art of keeping complex systems running smoothly in production.


### **Software Development**
From backend services to sytem level programming, I'll share code, patterns, and lessons learned from building software that powers infrastructure.

### **Cloud and Platform Strategy**
Strategic approaches to cloud adoption, multi-cloud architectures, and platform engineering. I'll explore how to build scalable platforms that enable teams to ship faster while maintaining security and cost efficiency.

## My Background

I'm passionate about turning messy cloud entities into resilient, secure and cost-savvy systems. My work spans across:

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Designing and implementing scalable cloud architectures
- **DevOps Practices**: Building robust & secure CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation
- **System Reliability**: Ensuring high availability and performance of critical systems
- **Cost Optimization**: Making cloud infrastructure both powerful and economical


## A Note on Content Migration
