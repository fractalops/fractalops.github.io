# Welcome to Rands & Sense! ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦

Your journey to financial literacy starts here. Whether you're earning your first paycheck or planning for retirement, we're here to help you make sense of your rands.

## Why Another Financial Blog?

Because most financial advice online is written for Americans or Europeans. We're different:

- **Local banks**: We talk about Capitec, FNB, Standard Bank, and Nedbank
- **Real amounts**: Our examples use rands, not dollars
- **SA regulations**: We understand SARS, medical aids, and retirement funds
- **Cultural context**: We get load shedding budgets and taxi fare inflation

## What Makes Us Different

**Practical, not theoretical**: Every post includes specific steps you can take this week.

**Beginner-friendly**: We explain financial jargon in plain English.

**Honest about challenges**: We acknowledge that R15,000 salary advice looks different from R150,000 salary advice.

## Coming Up

Over the next few weeks, we'll cover:

1. **Emergency Funds** - Your financial safety net (already live!)
2. **Budgeting Basics** - Without the spreadsheet overwhelm
3. **Tax-Free Savings** - R36,000 annual allowance explained
4. **First-Time Investing** - JSE for absolute beginners
5. **Banking 101** - Choosing accounts that don't drain your wallet
